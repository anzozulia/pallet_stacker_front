## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Risk-first Vertical MVP, built inside-out — pure transforms proven before any UI depends on them.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is foundational scaffolding only (no v1 requirement fully delivered there); acceptable for a version-lock phase.
- [Roadmap]: Version quartet (React 19.2.x / r3f 9 / drei 10 / three 0.184.0 exact) treated as a single locked unit, never auto-upgraded.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 2]: `orientation.perm` semantics (gather vs scatter) and whether `position.z` / `dimensions` are pre- or post-orientation are unresolved. Hard blocker for the viewer — must capture a real `done` response and write golden tests before implementing the mapper. Flagged for deeper research during Phase 2 planning.
- [Phase 7]: `packerapi.anzozulia.xyz` CORS allowlist must include the production serving origin before self-hosting ships (API is author-controlled).
- [Phase 6]: InstancedMesh ~100–200 box threshold is an estimate; verify empirically.
